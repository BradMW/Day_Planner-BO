Making a working day planner


If you ever feel like youre way to busy and too overwelmed to keep track of what needs to be done then I have a fix for you!

Here is a day planner made with a mix of html css js and jquery.

This day planner has a built in timer on top so you can quickly glance up at the time as well as color coded blocks so you know when you need  to action something.

Just click the text area and type in what you need to remember to do.

Now you too can bend time to your will with this work day scheduler.
